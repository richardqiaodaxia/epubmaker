      guide to the Objective-C programming language and some of its
      fundamental support libraries. This reference takes the form of brief
      explanations interspersed with examples and definitions. If you are
      experienced with Objective-C, this handbook will supply the definitions
      and examples you most often need to jog your memory. If you are coming
      to Objective-C from C++ or Java and prefer to jump right in and write
      code, this book will give you enough explanation to use the language's
      features appropriately.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01-4-fm2xml"/>Note</h3><p>You should be familiar with C-style languages in order to read
        this book. Objective-C uses C syntax. This book focuses only on
        Objective-C, and assumes that you understand the underlying C
        code.</p></div><p>This handbook progresses in sequence as much as possible, with
      later sections building on earlier ones, but some parts are necessarily
      interrelated. For example, the section on objects needs to refer to
      classes and vice versa. Both use the terminology of inheritance. Where
      you see an unfamiliar term used, check the index: it is probably defined
      elsewhere in the book.</p><p>Although Objective-C is (apart from its C base) a small language,
      the implications of its modest set of extensions are substantial. To use
      Objective-C effectively, you should follow tested design patterns and
      make judicious use of libraries. The intent of this handbook is to
      provide a quick reference to the most commonly used features and idioms
      of the language. It should be like a fast cache, the first stop for
      frequently used data.</p><p>Because of its size, this handbook can present only an outline of
      the language, its libraries, and conventional patterns of usage. If you
      are interested in truly understanding the Objective-C way of thinking,
      you should also look at some of the texts listed in <a class="link" href="ch01s17.html" title="Objective-C Resources">Section 1.17</a> at the end of this
      book.</p><p>For supplementary information and corrections to this handbook,

        considers every word. Greg Parker gave valuable feedback about the
        Objective-C runtime, Mark Bessey about the compiler, and Nicola Pero
        about archiving. Paul Kmiec asked the tough questions that made me
        think about how to explain the answers. Thanks also to Jacek Artymiak,
        Scott Anguish, and Eric Buck for their very thorough technical review
        of this book.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
